Name the three pillars of Science.

Name and briefly describe three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences.

Name the two types of scientific reasoning.

What is the difference between observational data and reality?

Name the three stages of scientific inference in the prediction pyramid.

What is a logical proposition?

Can a logical proposition be simultaneously both true and false in deductive reasoning? (Hint: Explain with an example.)

Does A⇒B
 necessitate B⇒A
? (Hint: Explain with an example.)

Represent via a Venn diagram, the logical sum or disjunction of two propositions: A+B
? (Hint: Take A
 and B
 to be two arbitrary propositions, i.e., circles in the Venn diagram that may partially overlap. Then draw the area that corresponds to A+B
.)

Represent via a Venn diagram, the logical product or conjunction of two propositions: A+B
? (Hint: Take A
 and B
 to be two arbitrary propositions, i.e., circles in the Venn diagram that may partially overlap. Then draw the area that corresponds to A+B
.)

Draw a Venn diagram of two propositions A
 and B
 that corresponds to A⇒B
. (Hint: Recall our class discussion and examples that A⇒B
 means that if A
 is true, then B
 is true. What configuration of two circles in a Venn diagram corresponding to propositions A
 and B
 would represent this statement?)

Provide an example that shows logical implication does not necessarily imply physical causation.

Policeman, jewelry, and burglar.

Consider the following series of questions:
a. What is the tiniest unit of information?
Hint: This unit also represents the tiniest bit of information in computers.
b. Why does this amount of information represent the tiniest information unit?
Hint: Use inductive logic with examples to explain your reasoning.
Imagine yourself as a single dot in empty space in a universe devoid of anything else.
Would you be able to tell your coordinates in the universe?
or whether you are moving? or at what constant speed?
Why? What extra piece of information do you need to answer the above questions?
c. Let’s assign a box to this tiniest representable amount of information.
Obviously, we cannot represent much information with it. So, our remedy is to put multiple of these boxes to represent information about something.
1. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 1 such boxes?
2. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 2 such boxes?
3. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 3 such boxes?
