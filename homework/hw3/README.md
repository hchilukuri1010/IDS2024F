Name the three pillars of Science.  
+  Theory  
+  Experiment  
+  Computation  
  
Name and briefly describe three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences.  
+  Climate: We can use data scince in understanding and predicting the effects of climate change and patterns using data anlaysis and simulation.  
+  Healthcare: We can use data analysis and machine learning to personalize patient care, treatment of patients, and predict disease outbreaks.
+  Finacial: We can use models and algorithms to analyze market trends, manage investment risks, and optimize finacial spending.

Name the two types of scientific reasoning.  
+  Deductive Reasoning  
+  Inductive Reasoning  

What is the difference between observational data and reality?  
+  Observational data is the data gained from experiments of the world, while the reality is the world. Observational data can be subject to errors or bias, so it might not accurately represent reality.  

Name the three stages of scientific inference in the prediction pyramid.  
+  Prediction
+  Validation
+  Calibration  

What is a logical proposition?  
+  A logical proposition is a  statement that is either true or false. It is a unit of logic used to make arguments and make conclusions.

Can a logical proposition be simultaneously both true and false in deductive reasoning? (Hint: Explain with an example.)  
+  A logical proposition cannot be both true and false in deductive reasoning. A proposition must be true or false, not both. For example, “It is raining” cannot be true and false at the same time.  

Does A⇒B necessitate B⇒A? (Hint: Explain with an example.)  
+ No. For example, If it rains (A), the ground will be wet (B). But if the ground is wet (B), it does not mean it has to be raining (A); someone could have spilled water.  

Represent via a Venn diagram, the logical sum or disjunction of two propositions: A+B? (Hint: Take A and B to be two arbitrary propositions, i.e., circles in the Venn diagram that may partially overlap. Then draw the area that corresponds to A+B.)  
+  In a Venn diagram, the logical sum of two propositions A+B is represented by the union of two circles area covered by the circles overlapping or not.

Represent via a Venn diagram, the logical product or conjunction of two propositions: A+B? (Hint: Take A and B to be two arbitrary propositions, i.e., circles in the Venn diagram that may partially overlap. Then draw the area that corresponds to A+B.)  
+  In a Venn diagram, the logical product of two propositions A⋅B is represented by the intersection of the two circles where both overlap.

Draw a Venn diagram of two propositions A and B that corresponds to A⇒B. (Hint: Recall our class discussion and examples that A⇒B means that if A is true, then B is true. What configuration of two circles in a Venn diagram corresponding to propositions A and B would represent this statement?  
+  In a Venn diagram, A circle is inside B circle meaning when A is true B is also true.  

Provide an example that shows logical implication does not necessarily imply physical causation.  
+   If the burglar enters the house, the jewelry is missing. This logical implication does not mean the burglar caused the jewelry to go missing, it means someone else could have taken it.  

Policeman, jewelry, and burglar.  
+  A ⇒ B ⇒ C ⇒ E, meaning that if the gentleman is seen crawling out of a broken window carrying jewelry (A(man crawling), B(out of a broken window), D( carrying jewlarry)), with the alarm sounding (C), the gentleman is likely a burglar (E).  

a. What is the tiniest unit of information?  
+  The bit is the tiniest unit of information. It can take one of two values: 0 or 1.
  
b. Why does this amount of information represent the tiniest information unit?
+  A bit is the smallest unit because it represents a binary choice that can only be in one of two possible conditions like 0 or 1 or on or off.

Imagine yourself as a single dot in empty space in a universe devoid of anything else.
Would you be able to tell your coordinates in the universe?
or whether you are moving? or at what constant speed?
Why? What extra piece of information do you need to answer the above questions?
c. Let’s assign a box to this tiniest representable amount of information.
Obviously, we cannot represent much information with it. So, our remedy is to put multiple of these boxes to represent information about something.  
1. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 1 such boxes?  
+  With 1 bit, you can represent 2 different things (0 or 1).  
2. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 2 such boxes?
+  With 2 bits, you can represent 4 different things (00, 01, 10, 11).  
3. How many different things can we assign to (or represent with) a collection of 3 such boxes?
+  With 3 bits, you can represent 8 different things (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111).
