What is the difference between observational data and reality (truth)?  
+  The difference between observational data and reality is that reality is a biased vision differing with each person while observational data cannot be biased or skewed.  

What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
+  Aesthetics in data visualization refer to the visual elements that represent data and aid in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships. Examples include position, color, size, and shape.

Consider the following color palettes. Which one is more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans? Why?  
+  The first original is the most effective with humans. The bright contrast of the colors prevents misinterpretation of the data the colors might symbolize.  

Which classes of color scales do the following color mappings belong to? Very briefly describe the primary use case of each class.  
+  A) Qualitative color scale: Used to distinguish discrete items or groups without a visible and distinct order, such as different countries on a map. 
+  B) Sequential color scale: Color can also represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed.  
+  C) Diverging color scale: Used to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.  
+  D) Accent color scales: Used to emphasize color in these figure elements in a color or set of colors that vividly stand out against the rest of the figure. The vividly stood-out colors emphasize specific data.

Which one(s) of the following statements are valid or invalid? Why?  
+  This person is breathing. =This person is inhaling and exhaling. This statement is valid because a person's breathing is true if the person is inhaling and exhaling and vice versa is also true.  
+  This person is breathing. ≡ This person is inhaling and exhaling. This is a valid statement because if a person is breathing then the person has to inhale and exhale.  
+  This person is conscious. ≡ This person is breathing. True statement because if the person is conscious then he will be breathing by definition.  
+  This person is conscious. = This person is breathing. True statement because a conscious person breathes and a breathing person is conscious.
+  It is rainy. ≡ The sky is cloudy. True statement because if it's raining then the sky has to be cloudy.  
+  It is rainy. = The sky is cloudy. False statement because if the sky is cloudy doesn't mean it has to rain.  

Name the three pillars of science.  
+  Theroy, Expierment, and Computation.

Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with a real-world example.  
+  No it isn't the same. For example, if a burglar enters the house, the jewelry is missing. The physical causation is that the jewelry is missing. But the logical implication could be that someone else took it. Logical implication does not mean the burglar caused the jewelry to go missing, it means someone else could have taken it.  

Suppose we have fit the following red line to the following blue dataset representing the global temperature increase of Earth over the past centuries.  
Is this visually a good fit in your opinion? Why?  
+  It is not a good fit. The reason it isn't a good fit is that the red linear trendline does not describe the data trend.  

What type of uncertainty dominates this dataset in the early years (before 1850)?  
+  Outliers. Before 1850 the data has a lot of outliers causing the data to spread more than it has to. The outliers skew the data causing the spread to increase and show us unnecessary data for the graph. The outliers can be attributed to the uncertainties in the measurement devices during that time. As the years progress the data becomes more fine and the data visuals more accurate.

Could this dataset be classified as time-series data? Why?  
+  Yes. Because the x-axis is based on years.

We can see a slight rise in temperature anomaly around the 1940s, followed by a slight temporary decline in temperature anomaly. What’s the likely reason for the observed trend around this time?  
+  The increase in the temperature can be attributed to the world events during that time such as World War II. The heavy industrializing that took place during that time could have introduced an anomaly increasing the global land temperature. The slight decrease afterward could be the adjustment back to normal temperatures after the war was over. The slight decrease is the self-adjustment of the environment and data.

Can we represent the probability as we define in science using integer numbers?  
+  No we cannot. Because we cannot define probability in a negative value or less than zero.

What are the consistency criteria required to define probability?  
+  If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then every possible way must lead to the same result.
+  We must always consider all the evidence relevant to a question. We should not arbitrarily ignore some information, basing the conclusions only on what remains.
+  We must always represent equivalent states of knowledge by equivalent plausibility assignments. That is, if the state of knowledge is the same (except perhaps for labeling the propositions) in two problems, then it must assign the same plausibilities in both.  

What is the equivalent of the following binary numbers 1, 01, and 10 in decimal representation?  
+  1=1, 01=1, 10=2

Are real numbers representable in modern digital computers? Explain you answer.  
+  Real numbers are not representable in modern digital computers because real numbers can hit infinity. Computers use finite binary values to approximate real numbers. 

Logic, Implication, Denial, Equivalence  
+  

What is the difference between Git and GitHub?  
+  Git is a software developed for version control systems while GitHub is a service that has Git but also can cater to a wider variety of needs.

Which school(s) of probability theory allow the incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference?  
+   Classical/Bayesian Probability.  

When data is scarce, which school of probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference?  
+  Bayesian School.

Which school of thought in Probability Theory cannot define or discuss the probability of the existence of God? Why?  
+  Frequentist. Because they only rely on data. So since God is a personal experience with each person having different experiences there cannot be data hence they don't define or discuss God.

Wrong visualization
+  The problem with the visualization is that you can't have an age younger than 0.

Why is everything represented by integers in computers?  
+  Because at the foundation of computer data, the integer values of 0 and 1 represent the on and off status.  

Name an ancestor programming language of C.
+  BCPL is the ancestor of the C coding language branch.  

Name the first high-level programming language in computer history.  
+  Fortran

Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide an example of each class.  
+ Deductive Reasoning: If all humans are mortals and I am a human therefore I am a mortal.
+ Inductive Reasoning: If the sun rises from the East then the sun will rise from the eat as well tomorrow.

What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?  
+  Two Boolean propositions are equal if they produce the same truth value under all possibilities.

27) The symbol represents conditional probability.
28) The answer is 1683. The way I got to this answer is that I saw that the first term is 3 and the difference between the first and second terms is 3. Then I realized that the final number is 99 and there are 33 numbers. I factored 3 out of the equation. Then I used a formula from my previous HW to get the answer 1683.
