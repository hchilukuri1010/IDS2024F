Name the three fundamental desiderata of Probability Theory  
+  Non-Negativity  
+  Normalization  
+  Additivity

What are aesthetics in data visualization?
+  Aesthetics in data visualization refer to the visual elements that represent data and aid in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships. Examples include position, color, size, and shape. Happens in graphs mostly.

Name the 2 major classes of aesthetics.
+  Primary Aesthetics: Directly map the represented data, such as its position in scatter plots.
+  Secondary Aesthetics: Help clarify the visualization for example its color, shape, and size.

Name the two major data types and provide an example for each category.
+  Quantitative data: Data that has measurable quantities. For example age, temperature, or grade.
+  Qualitative data: Data that is in groups. This includes types of fruits or regions on a map.  

What is a common name for variables that hold qualitative data?  
+  Categorical Variables

Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
+  Ordered Data: Data with a meaningful sequence. Example: Education levels like undergrad, masters, PhD.  
+  Unordered Data: Data with no inherent order. Examples are animals cats, dogs, mice, and birds.

What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
+  Month: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Ordered  
+  Day: Quantitative, Numerical, Discrete, Ordered  
+  Location: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Unordered  
+  Station ID: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Unordered  
+  Tempauture: Quantitative, Numerical, Continous, Ordered

What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  
+  Axes that represent comparable quantities should be represented with the same units and grid size.

Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.  
+  One example is the use of a logarithmic scale for an axis when dealing with data that spans multiple orders of magnitude, such as population sizes or financial data.  

Which one of the following three coordinates is valid and can be used to represent data?  
+  e1 and e2

Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.  
+  Sequential Color Scale: Used for visualizing data with a natural progression, such as temperature, population density, or elevation.  
+  Diverging Color Scale: Ideal for showing data with deviations from a  reference point, such as profit/loss or temperature anomalies.
+  Categorical Color Scale:  Used for non-ordered categorical data, such as regions, product types, or political parties.  
+  Perceptually Uniform Color Scale: Ideal for precise and accurate interpretation of data, especially for scientific visualizations or accessibility for colorblind users.

What's wrong with the visualization?  
+  On the x-axis, the graph wouldn't make sense if you go into negative age. The visualization is misleading since negative age doesn't exist.

Consider the following color palettes. Which one is more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans?  
+  The second palette is more appropriate. The reason becasue the first pallete is going to be hard on color-blind humans. The second palette can help a wide range of humans.

The four major schools are:
+  Classical Probability
+  Frequentist Probability
+  Subjective Probability
+  Axiomatic Probability

Extra credit 1:  
+ Frog is the only living creature I see.

Extra credit 2:  
+  I would move one matchstick from the 8 to make it a 6 and move that one matchstick to the 0 to make a 5. This would become 6+3-4=5.
