Name and describe briefly the steps involved in scientific inference.  
+  First a natural phenomenon occurs. This leads to some observational data to be taken, which the leads to model construction, calibration, and validation. After all these steps occur then a prediction is formed. This is a brief description of the scientific inference.

Name the three pillars of science.  
+  Theory
+  Experiment
+  Computation

Describe three different major applications of the third pillar of science with respect to the first two. (Hint: Recall the discussions we had early in the semester during the first lecture series. Where and how could the third pillar replace the other pillars?)  
+  Climate: We can use data scince in understanding and predicting the effects of climate change and patterns using data analysis and simulation.
+  Healthcare: We can use data analysis and machine learning to personalize patient care, and treatment of patients, and predict disease outbreaks.
+  Financial: We can use models and algorithms to analyze market trends, manage investment risks, and optimize financial spending.

Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide an example of each class.  
+  Deductive
+  Plausible

What is the relationship between data and reality? Can we observe reality?
(Hint: Recall the discussions we had early in the semester during the first lecture series. Remember the pyramid of scientific inference.)  
+  Observational data is the data gained from experiments of the world, while reality is the world. Observational data can be subject to errors or bias, so it might not accurately represent reality. Reality is what we see with our senses.  

What is the difference between model validation and calibration?  
+  The difference between validation and calibration is that validation is a more refined calibration that even gets more refined and moves to prediction.

Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with an example.  
+  If the burglar enters the house, the jewelry is missing. This logical implication does not mean the burglar caused the jewelry to go missing, it means someone else could have taken it.

Who is the Boolean algebra named after?  
+  George Boole 

Illustrate the logical conjunction via a Venn Diagram.  
+  

Illustrate the logical disjunction via a Venn Diagram.  
+  

What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?  
+  Two propositions with the same truth value are equally plausible.
   
What is the result of adding two propositions that complement each other Explain your answer with an example.
+  At least one of the propositions, A, B is true. For example, when it rains(A) there are clouds(B). Without B, A won't happen.  So B is always true if A is happening.  

What is the result of multiplying (that is, conjunction of) two propositions that complement each other? Explain your answer with an example.  
+  Both A and B are true. For example, the light(A) causes photosynthesis to occur in plants(B). This is true both ways, if photosynthesis is to occur it needs light.

Display the logical implication A⇒B via a Venn diagram.
(Hint. Think about the meaning of logical implication A⇒B: If A is true, then B must be true. If A is false, then B can be either true or false. What configuration of A and B circles in a Venn diagram would correspond to the above statement for logical implication? Recall that when you are inside an object (circle) in a Venn diagram, it means the proposition corresponding to that object is true. When you are outside, the proposition is false.)  
+  

What is the tiniest unit of information?  
+  The bit is the tiniest unit of information. It can take one of two values: 0 or 1.  

Imagine our universe was empty with nothing in it. Does this universe contain any information?  
+  No.

Consider 4 bits of storage. How many integers (or call it different states, or different possibilities) can you represent with it?  
+  32

Consider 4 boxes each of which can take 3 possible values (or call it states): −1,0,+1. How many decimal integers (or call it different states, or different possibilities) can you represent with these 4 boxes?  
+  3
