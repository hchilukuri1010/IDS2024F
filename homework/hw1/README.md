	Local VCS
	Centralized VCS (CVCS)
	Distributed VCS (DVCS)
4) The best of the three systems is the Distributed VCS. The DVCS allows the client to have a copy of the central database on a personal storage device. This allows multiple users to work with the data simultaneously and also allows for a clone backup in case the data is deleted.
5) Commands for GitHub:
	git pull - pulls the latest changes from the server to the local copy of the project.
	git status - shows the current state of the GIT directory
	git add --all - adds new or changed files in the working directory
	git commit -m"latest build" - shows all the commits in a chronological format starting from the recent one
	git push --all - updates the remote branch with the local commits

3) A relative path describes the file's location relative to the current directory. An absolute path describes the location from the root directory.
