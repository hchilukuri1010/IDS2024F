What is the fastest component of computer memory?  
+  Registers  

Why is modern computer memory comprised of a multilevel (hierarchical) structure?  
+  It is a faster way and it is cheaper to have it this way. And this model is also space effecient.  
  
What is the slowest kind of computer storage device?  
+ Hard Disk Drives  

Name the hierarchy of the memory of modern computers, from the smallest to the largest memory size.  
+ Disk, Dram, L3, L2, L1, and Registers  

What is smallest unit of information in computers? (Hint: Recall our computer programming lecture)  
+  Bit
  
Why have humans chosen the binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent data in computers?  
+ Because at the foundation of computer data, the integer values of 0 and 1 represent the on and off status.

What is the typical speed of contemporary computer memory registers?  
+ They are about 100 to 1000 times faster than RAM.

What decade was the first digital computer built?  
+  1940

What decade was the first general-purpose digital computer built?
+  1945

What is a fixed program computer?  
+  An computer that can only run code that it is physically wired to code for.

Name an example of modern-day fixed program computer.  
+  ENIAC

What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge?  
+  Declarative is statements of fact while imperative is how to get something done.

Classify the following statements as imperative or declarative knowledge.  
+  a. The letter B is the second letter in the English alphabet. **Declarative**
+  b. Overcast sky conditions are more likely to cause rain. **Imperative**
+  c. Submit your answer to this question in subfolder 2 of quiz folder of your GitHub project. **Imperative**
+  e. Once done with this quiz, do not forget to commit your responses to your repository. **Declarative**
+  d. You must answer all questions in this quiz to get a full grade. **Declarative**  

What class of human knowledge algorithms belong to?  
+ Imperative

What is the name of the first digital computer?  
+  ENIAC  

Name a computer programming language whose evolution and popularity is tightly coupled with the field of Bioinformatics.  
+ Python

Name a computer programming language whose evolution and popularity is tightly coupled with the field of Numerical Computing, Atmospheric Science, Plasma Sciences, and Aerospace Engineering, among others.  
+  Fortran

Name the five major components of a modern digital computer.
+ CPU, Memory Unit, Arithmetic Block, Register, Program counter, and Control Unit

Name an example of fixed-program computer.  
+  ENIAC

Order the following languages chronologically according to their birth date. (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes)
Java, COBOL, C++, Python, Fortran, B  
+ Fortran, COBOL, B, C++, Java, and Python.

(A) What is the closest human-readable programming language to machine code (i.e., binary numbers)?  
+ Python Language  

(B) Does it need interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible?  
+  No

(A) Name the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use.  
+ Fortran

(B) Approximately how many decades is it old? (±15
 years is acceptable answer. the decade Tt was created is also an acceptable answer.)  
+ 1956
(A) Name a second-generation programming language.
+ Assembly

(B) Which language-generation are Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, R?  
+  Third or Fourth Generation.

In what decades C, C++, MATLAB, and Python were created, respectively? (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes)  
+  2000 Decade.
  
Name an ancestor programming language of C (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).  
+ BCPL is the ancestor of the C coding language branch.  

Name a programming language ancestor of C++ (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).  
+ C with Classes.  

Name a programming language ancestor of MATLAB and a programming language ancestor of Python (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).
+ ABC and Oberon. 

How do you define logarithm? Explain with a simple example just as we did in class.  
+ A logarithm is a math operation that is the inverse of an exponential function with the function Log serving as the main base.

Consider the following summation:
S=3+6+9+…+93+96+99 .

What is the value of S? Explain your novel strategy to get your answer.
(Hint: Recall the chessboard problems in our HW and class discussions. How did we solve them in class? There are 33 numbers in the summation above.)  
+ The value of s would be 1.66*10^16. The strategy I used was to create a geometric formula from the data given to find the value of s.

Extra Credit. Which memory device is longer lasting: magnetic tapes or HDD (Hard-Disk Drives)? How many years approximately each one last (a rough reasonable estimate is good enough)?  
+  

Extra Credit. Can you name a fixed-program computer that existed for centuries before the invention of the first digital computer?  
+ FERMIAC

Extra Credit. Consider the following multiplication:
S=101×102×103×…×10100 .
 What is the value of S? Explain your novel strategy to get your answer.  
 +  The way to get the answer would be to create an equation following that trend and use it. So the value of s would be 10,002,001.
