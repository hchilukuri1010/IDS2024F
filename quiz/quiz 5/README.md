Name four major historical definitions of Probability.
Which school(s) of thought defines probability as the degree of belief?  
+  The Bayesian School of Thought  

Which school(s) of thought defines probability as the relative frequency of occurrence?  
+  The Frequentist School of Thought

Which probability definition(s), among those we have discussed in class, allow defining the Probability of the existence of God? Why?  
+  The Subjective Definition of probability allows for this definition because it is based on personal beliefs or personal experiences.  

Is Bayesian Inference a subset of the Frequentist Inference methods? Why?  
+  Nope. Bayesian inference takes into personal accounts of experience while the Frequentist inference only takes into account the data gathered. 

Which inference methodology allows the inclusion of expert knowledge in data analysis and decision-making?  
+  Bayesian Inference because it takes into account the pior knowledge of the expert to factor into the decision-making.  

Why is Bayesian Probability Theory more popular among physicists and engineers and Frequentist Probability Theory more popular among Biologists and Social Scientists? (Hint: Recall the example we discussed in class experiments that can never be repeated.)  
+  Bayesian Methods are popular in physics and engineering because they use the prior knowledge that is useful in a single one-time complex experiment. The experiment is so complex it cannot be repeated.  
+  Frequentist methods are favored in biology and social sciences because they deal with repeatable experiments with large amounts of data gathered.  

When did the first modern definition of Probability appear in history?  
+  It appeared in Frequentist Probability around the 1780s.

What kinds of uncertainty exist in our experiments?  
+  Aleatory Uncertainty
+  Epistemic Uncertainty  

Suppose there is a donkey outside the classroom. I ask you what you observe and tell me what you see. You tell me that you see a horse. What kind of uncertainty is involved in your observation?  
+  Epistemic Uncertainty  

What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
+  Aesthetics in data visualization refer to the visual elements that represent data and aid in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships. Examples include position, color, size, and shape.

Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
+  Primary Aesthetics  
+  Secondary Aesthetics  

What is the difference between factors and levels?  
+   Factors: Categorical variables in a dataset.
+   Levels: The unique categories within a factor.

Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
+ Quantitative data: Data that has measurable quantities. For example age, temperature, or grade.
+ Qualitative data: Data that is in groups. This includes types of fruits or regions on a map.

What is the common name for variables holding data?  
+  Data Attribute  

Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
+  Ordered Data: Data with a meaningful sequence. Example: Education levels like undergrad, masters, PhD.
+  Unordered Data: Data with no inherent order. Examples are animals cats, dogs, mice, and birds.

Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.  
+  Sequential Color Scale: Used for visualizing data with a natural progression, such as temperature, population density, or elevation.
+  Diverging Color Scale: Ideal for showing data with deviations from a reference point, such as profit/loss or temperature anomalies.
+  Categorical Color Scale: Used for non-ordered categorical data, such as regions, product types, or political parties.
+  Perceptually Uniform Color Scale: Ideal for precise and accurate interpretation of data, especially for scientific visualizations or accessibility for colorblind users.  

Professional Data Scientists tend to avoid 3D plots in their visualizations. Why?  
+  The 3rd dimension of the plot makes it difficult for the reader understand the data that is visualized. The 3D causes the data to be clustered and difficult to interpret.  

Recall our class discussions on the kinds of data, for example, numerical vs. categorical.
Describe an example dataset that could be classified as either numerical or categorical, depending on how it is represented.  
+  

Is color a categorical/unordered or quantitative/ordered aesthetic?
+  Color is a categorical/unordered aesthetic. This is because with color you can organize it and it doesn't have to follow a certain order.  

The combination of a set of position scales and their relative geometric arrangement is called a coordinate system.
Coordinate systems allow us to assign unique IDs (a set of numbers called coordinates) to a unique location on a map (think of Google map pins, for example).
When we deal with data, these unique IDs are often assumed to be data values that we want to visualize and each coordinate axis corresponds to a single data attribute.
Given this information, which one of the following three coordinates is valid and can be used to represent data or visualize the data attribute values? (Hint: Recall that the sole criterion for the validity of coordinates is the ability to assign a unique set of numbers (data values) to unique points in the coordinates space (visualization space).)

Consider the following color palettes. Which one is more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans?  
+  The second pallet. The first pallet may pose a challenge to a reader of the data who might be colorblind.

Which city’s temperature is the least varying throughout the year (mostly the same temperature)?  
+ San Diego
Which city’s temperature is the wildest varying throughout the year (sometimes relatively very hot or some times relatively very cold)?
+  Chicago
Which city is the hottest in the month of January?
+  San Diego
Which city is the coolest in the month of July?
+  San Diego  

Which classes of color scales the following color-mappings belong to?  
+  A

What kind of data set can be best visualized in polar coordinates?  
+ Data that has a periodic nature.

Which color scale has been used in the following visualization?  
+  D (Okabe Ito Accent, Grays with accents, ColorBrewer Accent)

What is ugly in the following graph?  
+  The slanted x axis labels makes it harder to read and define each of the data bars. The y axis label is captailzed correctly.  

Just by looking at this graph, do you think the temperature of Earth will increase or decrease in the following decades?  
+ The temperature will increase.

Approximately, how much hotter or cooler do you think Earth will be in 2050 with respect to the average temperatures during 1951-1980 (the zero-anomaly temperature)? Express your answer in units of Celsius or Fahrenheit if you like (1 Celsius is about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit).  
+  I estimate that the temperature will raise around 3-4 degrees Celsius.
